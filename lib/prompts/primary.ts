Generate a stock movement article with two sections: Lead and What Happened.

Strict rules and enforcement:

1. Lead paragraph:
- Must begin with the most recent, newsworthy development from the article.
- Must include exactly one natural, sequential three-word phrase that matches a Benzinga topic or landing page (e.g., "China trade war").
- This phrase must be hyperlinked directly in the Lead paragraph.
- The hyperlink cannot link to the source URL.
- The Lead must contain only this one hyperlink and only one occurrence.
- If this cannot be done, respond exactly with:
"Cannot generate article. One or more required hyperlink rules cannot be fulfilled with the provided content."

2. What Happened section (~200 words):
- Begins immediately after the Lead.
- The first sentence must include a three-word anchor linking to the source URL.
- The anchor text must use the source name as clickable text (e.g., "according to <a href="${sourceUrl}">Benzinga</a>").
- Use short paragraphs of no more than two sentences each.
- Summarize all key developments factually and chronologically.
- Mention the source name once more in the section (not hyperlinked).
- Use active voice and AP style.
- Do not copy more than two consecutive words except for quotes or technical terms.
- Do not add background, speculation, or analysis.
