STORY REQUIREMENTS:

1. HEADLINE: 
- Use format "[Company] Stock Is Trending ${currentDayName}: What's Going On?" or "[Company] Stock Launches To New All-Time Highs: What's Going On?" for new highs
- The headline should be on its own line, separate from the lead paragraph
- Do NOT use bold formatting (**) around the headline
- Do NOT include the headline within the lead paragraph

2. ARTICLE STRUCTURE:
- HEADLINE: On its own line, no bold formatting
- Opening paragraph: Compelling hook that draws readers in + engaging narrative about what's driving the stock (separate from headline)
- "What To Know" section: Key data points (growth rankings, revenue metrics)
- Recent events/partnerships/announcements (incorporate relevant recent Benzinga articles if available)
- Analyst commentary and price target updates
- Price action section with technical details
- Formatted price line at the bottom with exact price action data

3. CONTENT GUIDELINES:
- Focus on what's driving the momentum
- Include technical indicators (RSI, moving averages, support/resistance)
- Mention analyst ratings and price targets (emphasize FIRM names over analyst names)
- Include volume analysis and short interest if relevant
- Reference upcoming catalysts (earnings, events, etc.)

- Use direct, clear, and journalistic language
- Avoid flowery language like "amidst," "amid," "whilst," etc.
- Avoid phrases like "In summary," "To summarize," "In conclusion," etc.
- Avoid phrases like "despite the absence of," "in the absence of," "without specific news catalysts," etc.
- Write like a professional financial news publication
- Keep paragraphs short and impactful
- Include current session price movement
- Use active voice and strong verbs
- Avoid repetitive information - do not repeat the same price, percentage, or data points multiple times in the article
- PRICE ACTION CONTEXT:
  * Use the market status (premarket, regular hours, after-hours, closed) to provide accurate context
  * Reference the appropriate session data when discussing price movements
  * If in premarket: mention "premarket trading" and use premarket data
  * If in after-hours: mention "after-hours trading" and use after-hours data
  * If during regular hours: use regular session data
  * If market is closed: reference the most recent session data
  * Be specific about which trading session the price movement occurred in
  * LEAD PARAGRAPH PRICE MOVEMENT: The first sentence of the lead paragraph MUST describe the actual price movement from the price action data (e.g., if changePercent is positive, say "traded higher" or "rose"; if negative, say "traded lower" or "declined"; if zero, say "traded unchanged")
- FORMATTED PRICE LINE REQUIREMENTS:
  * At the very end of the article, add a formatted price line with exact price action data
  * Use this exact format: "[TICKER] Price Action: [Company Name] shares were [up/down] [X.XX]% at $[XX.XX] [during premarket trading/during after-hours trading/while the market was closed] on [Day], according to <a href="https://pro.benzinga.com">Benzinga Pro</a>."
  * Include the exact percentage change, current price, and market status
  * This should be the final line of the article, after all other content including "Also Read" and "Read Next" sections
  * DO NOT repeat the exact same price and percentage information that appears elsewhere in the article
- LEAD PARAGRAPH REQUIREMENTS:
  * Start with a compelling hook that makes readers want to continue
  * Keep the lead to exactly TWO sentences maximum - no exceptions
  * Each sentence should be concise and impactful (avoid run-on sentences)
  * First sentence: Start with the company name and ticker, then describe the ACTUAL price movement based on the price data (e.g., "traded higher", "declined", "rose", "fell") and use the exact time reference from market status (e.g., "in premarket trading", "during regular trading hours", "in after-hours trading"). ${articlesWithDateContext.length > 0 ? `MUST include exactly one hyperlink using this format: <a href="${articlesWithDateContext[0]?.url}">[three word phrase]</a>` : ''}
  * Second sentence: Brief context about what's driving the momentum (NO exact price action, NO hyperlinks)
  * CRITICAL: The lead MUST mention the actual price movement (up, down, unchanged) but NOT the specific percentage - reserve the percentage for the price action line at the bottom
  * Use the market status to provide accurate time context (premarket, regular hours, after-hours, closed)
  * Avoid robotic language like "is experiencing notable volatility" or "recently trading down"
  * Use engaging, human language that tells a story
  * Focus on the narrative - what's happening and why it matters
  * Do NOT include any hyperlinks in the lead paragraph
  * Make it sound like a real journalist wrote it, not an AI
  * LEAD LENGTH RULE: If your lead exceeds two sentences, rewrite it to be more concise
  * EXAMPLE LEAD PARAGRAPH FORMAT:
    * First sentence: "[Company Name] (NYSE: TICKER) traded higher in premarket trading on Monday as investors continue to focus on the company's <a href="${articlesWithDateContext[0]?.url || 'https://www.benzinga.com/markets'}">strong fundamentals</a>."
    * Second sentence: "The stock's momentum comes amid positive analyst sentiment and strong technical indicators."

4. RECENT ARTICLES INTEGRATION:
${articlesWithDateContext.length > 0 ? `
- CRITICAL REQUIREMENT: You MUST include exactly TWO hyperlinks using this exact format: <a href="[ARTICLE_URL]">[three word phrase]</a>
- Use one hyperlink from each of the two articles provided - NO EXCEPTIONS
- YOU MUST USE BOTH ARTICLES - DO NOT SKIP ANY ARTICLES
- FAILURE TO INCLUDE BOTH HYPERLINKS WILL RESULT IN INCOMPLETE CONTENT
- REQUIRED URLS TO USE:
  * Article 1 URL: ${articlesWithDateContext[0]?.url}
  * Article 2 URL: ${articlesWithDateContext[1]?.url}
- You MUST use these exact URLs in your hyperlinks
- Choose relevant three-word phrases from the article headlines or content
- Embed the hyperlinks naturally in your sentences - do NOT say "according to a recent article" or "recent article" or "article"
- HYPERLINK DISTRIBUTION: Include one hyperlink in a middle paragraph (paragraphs 2-4) and one hyperlink in another middle paragraph
- HYPERLINK INTEGRATION: The hyperlinks should be embedded within existing sentence structure, NOT as standalone phrases
- CRITICAL: NEVER create sentences that end with "here" or "this link" - hyperlinks must be part of natural sentence flow
- HYPERLINK RULE: The hyperlink should be a natural part of the sentence, not a separate instruction to the reader
- EXAMPLES OF GOOD HYPERLINK INTEGRATION:
  * "The company's <a href="url">AI platform developments</a> continue to drive momentum..."
  * "Analysts remain bullish on the stock's <a href="url">recent partnership announcements</a>..."
  * "Investors are watching the company's <a href="url">regulatory compliance strategy</a>..."
  * "Recent <a href="url">regulatory developments</a> have sparked renewed interest..."
  * "The company's <a href="url">strategic positioning</a> continues to attract investor attention..."
- EXAMPLES OF BAD HYPERLINK INTEGRATION (DO NOT USE):
  * "For more insights, check out this week in Appleverse."
  * "Read more about the latest developments here."
  * "See related coverage on this topic."
  * "According to a recent article..."
  * "A recent article shows..."
  * "The recent article..."
  * "For more on [topic], see [source] here."
  * "Click here for more information."
  * "Read more here."
  * "See [topic] here."
  * "Check out [topic] here."
  * Any sentence ending with "here" or "this link"
  * Any standalone hyperlink phrases that don't flow naturally in the text
- MANDATORY CHECKLIST:
  * [ ] Headline is on its own line, separate from lead paragraph
  * [ ] No bold formatting (**) around headline
  * [ ] Lead paragraph is exactly TWO sentences maximum
  * [ ] First sentence contains company name, ticker, actual price movement with time context, and one hyperlink (NO exact percentage)
  * [ ] Second sentence provides brief context about momentum drivers (NO exact price action, NO hyperlinks)
  * [ ] No run-on sentences in the lead
  * [ ] Lead paragraph contains exactly ONE hyperlink (in the first sentence)
  * [ ] First hyperlink from Article 1 included in the lead paragraph (first sentence)
  * [ ] Second hyperlink from Article 2 included in a middle paragraph (paragraphs 2-4)
  * [ ] Both hyperlinks use three-word phrases
  * [ ] Both hyperlinks are naturally embedded in sentences
  * [ ] No standalone hyperlink phrases
  * [ ] NO references to "article," "recent article," or "Benzinga article"
  * [ ] Hyperlinks are part of natural sentence flow
  * [ ] NO sentences ending with "here" or "this link"
  * [ ] NO "For more on [topic], see [source] here" formatting
  * [ ] Hyperlinks flow naturally within sentences, not as separate instructions
  * [ ] "Also Read" section placed immediately after "What To Know" section (top third of article)
  * [ ] Formatted price line included at the very end with exact price action data
  * [ ] "Benzinga Pro" hyperlinked in the price line
  * [ ] No repetitive price/percentage information throughout the article
- DATE AWARENESS: Consider the age of each article when writing:
  * If article is 1-3 days old: Use "recently", "this week", "latest"
  * If article is 4-7 days old: Use "this week", "recently", "lately"
  * If article is 8-14 days old: Use "recently", "in recent weeks", "lately"
  * If article is older: Use "previously", "earlier this month", "recently"
- Avoid referencing future events that have already happened based on article dates
- FINAL VERIFICATION: Before submitting your response, count the number of <a href= tags in your article. You must have exactly 5 total hyperlinks:
  * 1 in the lead paragraph (first sentence)
  * 1 embedded in a middle paragraph (paragraphs 2-4)
  * 1 in "Also Read" section
  * 1 in "Read Next" section  
  * 1 in "Benzinga Pro" price line
  * If you have fewer than 5, add the missing hyperlink(s). If you have more than 5, remove the extra hyperlink(s).
- HYPERLINK PLACEMENT STRATEGY:
  * Article 1 hyperlink: Place in the lead paragraph (first sentence), naturally integrated into the sentence about price movement and market context
  * Article 2 hyperlink: Place in a middle paragraph (paragraphs 2-4), naturally integrated into a sentence about recent developments or market context
  * Both hyperlinks must be relevant to the context where they appear
  * LEAD PARAGRAPH RULE: MUST include one hyperlink in the lead paragraph (first sentence)
  * CRITICAL: You MUST embed both hyperlinks naturally in the article content, NOT just in the "Also Read" and "Read Next" sections
  * The "Also Read" and "Read Next" sections are ADDITIONAL to the embedded hyperlinks, not replacements for them
  * HYPERLINK REQUIREMENT: You MUST include exactly 2 embedded hyperlinks (1 in lead + 1 in middle paragraph)
  * DO NOT rely only on "Also Read" and "Read Next" sections - you need hyperlinks within the actual article text
- REQUIRED HYPERLINK COUNT: Your final article MUST contain exactly 5 hyperlinks total:
  * 1 embedded hyperlink in the lead paragraph (from Article 1)
  * 1 embedded hyperlink in a middle paragraph (from Article 2)
  * 1 "Also Read" hyperlink (from Article 1)
  * 1 "Read Next" hyperlink (from Article 2)
